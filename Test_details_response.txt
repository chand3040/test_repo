Following are the details of the remote test:

The task is to build a simple website that allows you to upload a simple CSV file and do cross tabulation on that data.- It has one upload button.Comment : This have been created and proper validation has been done both on server and javascript side.- It has one table that shows the data from the CSV file.Comment : Well I didn't store the data in database table yes but I have done by showing table in frontend. One can alos save the data that will be saved in DB in Json format.- There are two dropdowns where I can choose the columns on which to do cross tabulationComment:- Yes this is there and validated using HTML5  and also on server side- It has another table where it shows the result of cross tabulation.Comment: Yes there is table where it shows data for the same after selecting the data from FORM.

Attached is a simple CSV that illustrates what kind of data can be uploaded.Comment : This CSV has been tested and the webapp works with this CSV
Note: in case if you are not aware, research on what is cross tabulation. Wikipedia has a very good example on this.Comment :- Did and Implemented the same.The idea is to build:- A usable Front EndComment : It is there with a very simple UI.- A good BackendComment:- Django Admin Panel- Deploy on a serverComment : This can be depeloyed to development server. One only needs to start a runserver of Django- Submit verifiable data and numbers about scalability and efficiency of backendComment :- Well for scalability there are no special steps taken but the code is in proper format where it should be. Also I have done the functionality using python-pandas that really make life easy.- Documentation and a note on Design DecisionsComment:- Its Fully in MTV(Model Template view format of Django)
Feel free to ask should you run into queries or confusion.
Steps to start with this project:-PREREQUISITES:-1. Python 2.72. Django 1.83. Database will be shipped with the code in SQLLITE so no worries.4. GCC in case of Linux Systems(This will be required to install the dependencies)1.  Install requirements using  "pip install -r cross_tabulation/requirements.txt"Note : If you have any issues with the same you need to solve them as it may vary from system to system.2.  pull the code using "git clone https://github.com/chand3040/test_repo.git3.  Now change directory to cross_tabulation.4.  run this command "python manage.py runserver 8080"5.  hit url at http://:127.0.0.1:8080/upload  (Cool this would start the journey)About the admin Panel its Django's Admin Panel:-It can been seen at http://:127.0.0.1:8080/admin username:admin password:admin
